# Personal site for barnabybishop.com - 2019

This is a homage to the first website I remember building.

It was back in the 90's, on Geocities and it was space themed. I remember struggling a lot to get images to change on hover using Javascript I found on a CD from a computer magazine.

This site was built similarly to how I (attempted) to build websites in those days:

One file with all the HTML, CSS and Javascript.

- No libraries.
- No frameworks.
- No build tools.
